Usage
=====

.. tip::

    This package can be used as a CLI tool, but mainly was designed to be deployed in AWS.
    See installation :ref:`sam_sar_install` for more information.


As AWS SAM Application
-----------------------

The SAM application you can install from `AWS SAR Page for ECR Scan Reporter`_ will deploy 3 Lambda functions
which will be triggered based on their usage. It will also be deploying a Lambda Layer which contains the
application source code of this repository so to make it simple to update all 3 functions together without making their
code too complex.
